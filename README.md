#### CSESoc 2023 Trainee Technical Challenge.

#### In spite of the fact that this website is mobile friendly, I recommend viewing it in a larger browser window.

# Details

- A personal page developed with HTML5 & CSS
- Must incorporate the theme "Circles"

# Themes

Circular objects have been incorporated wherever possible, particularly into images and icons. The purple colour theme of CSEsoc also inspired me.

Things inspired from CSESOC Circles:

- Circular borders
- Purple background
- Hover effect within text
- Smooth transition during scrolling
